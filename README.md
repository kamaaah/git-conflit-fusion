# If I Ever Fall in Love
# Shai
# The very first time that I saw your brown eyes
# Your lips said "Hello" and I said "Hi"
# I knew right then you were the one
# But I was caught up
# In physical attraction
# But to my satisfaction
# Baby, you were more than just a phase
# And if I ever (Ever fall)
# In love again (Again)
# I will be sure that the lady is a friend
# And if I ever (Ever fall)
# In love so true (So true)
# I will be sure that the lady's just like you
# Oh, yeah, yeah, y-y-y-yeah
# The very next time she'll be my friend
# If I say that I could be your one and only
# (Promise, promise, promise)
# Promise that you'll never leave me lonely
# I just wanna be the one you need
# Oh, baby
# I just wanna be the one to serve you
# Sometimes, I feel as if I don't deserve you
# I cherish every moment that we share
# And if I ever (Ever fall)
# In love again (Again)
# I will be sure that the lady is a friend
# And if I ever (Ever fall)
# In love so true (So true)
# I will be sure that the lady's just like you
# Very next time she will be my friend
# Someone who I can believe in
# (My friend)
# Very next time she will be my friend
# Someone who I can believe in
# (My friend)
# Very next time she will be my friend
# Someone who I can believe in
# Very next time she will be my friend
# And if I ever (Ever fall)
# In love again (Again)
# I will be sure that the lady is a friend
# And if I ever (Ever fall)
# In love so true (So true)
# I will be sure that the lady's just like you
